# HR-Dashboard
Data Visualisation - Tableau - Figma

This dashboard highlight some HR information
- **Overall information** : number of employees, department repartition, collaborators location...
- Some **demographics** exploring relations between gender, age, education background and performances.
- Information about **income** : gender pay gap, avg income by age and position.

I used here some fictionnal data made with ChatGPT and the Faker library.

I ended my project by a quick work on the **design** using **Figma** to implement containers with rounded corners and play a bit with the light.

You can find the dashboard on my Tableau Web page : **https://public.tableau.com/views/HRdashboard_17387789283120/HRSummary?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link**
